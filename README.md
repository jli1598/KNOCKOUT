<p> Knockout is a two-player fighting game. The objective of the game is to battle using two characters. In each round, two fighters will engage in mortal combat. When a player's health is at zero, he/she will lose the game. The goal is to win the round and be the last one standing. The keyboard will be used to control the fighter such as going forwards or backwards, as well as summoning the fighterâ€™s special abilities. Like Street Fighter, each character has special abilities, which makes it more difficult for the other player to react and dodge. The round will end when a player loses or reaches a health of zero. The name of the fighter who wins will be displayed at the end of the game.</p>
