<p> Knockout is a two-player fighting game. The objective of the game is to fight one another through two characters. There would be two fighters engaged in mortal combat consisting of one round. When a player's health is at zero, he/ she will lose the game. The goal is to win the round and be the last one standing. The keyboard would be used to control the fighter such as going forwards or backwards, as well as summoning the fighterâ€™s special abilities. Each character will consists of their own special abilities, which will make it more difficult for the other player to react and dodge. It depends on how the players will interacts with their character. The round will end when a player loses or reaches a health of zero and the fighter's name will be displayed at the end.</p>
